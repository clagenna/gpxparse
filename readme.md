# purposes
When you draw spread routes on Garmin Basecamp with few waypoints what you see in Basecamp
may differ from what you see in (my Zumo 595) navigator.
To suply recalculating routes on my Garmin Zumo 595 
I added (every 2000 m or whatever you decide)  new intermediate waypoints on an exported 
*.gpx file.

The new gpx file will have an extention of "_CONWP.gpx"
